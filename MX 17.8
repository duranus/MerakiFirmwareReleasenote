Important noticeWhile Meraki appliances have traditionally relied on UDP port 7351 for cloud communication and TCP ports 80 and 443 for backup communications, with MX 16 we are beginning a transition to using TCP port 443 as the primary means for cloud connectivity. In order to ensure proper connectivity to the Meraki cloud after this upgrade, please ensure that traffic using TCP port 443 between 209.206.48.0/20 is allowed through any firewalls that may be deployed upstream of your Meraki appliances.HTTP proxy, which allows default management traffic from MX appliances to be sent through a proxy, is deprecated on MX 16 and higher firmware versions.The transition to Cisco Talos intelligence for our content filtering services means that some URL categories have changed names, some categories are no longer available, and multiple new categories are now available. Please review your configuration after upgrading to ensure content filtering is effectively tailored to your needs and deployment environment.Legacy products noticeWhen configured for this version, Z1, MX60, MX60W, MX80, and MX90 devices will run MX 14.56.When configured for this version, MX400 and MX600 devices will run MX 16.16.3.Bug fixesBGP stability improvements.Resolved a case that resulted in MX appliances improperly routing traffic to clients behind an IPv6 static route.Resolved several rare cases that could result in device reboots.Resolved a rare case where port speed and duplex settings applied via the local status page would not be honored if settings had previously been configured on MX 12 or earlier.Resolved a rare issue that could result in MX appliances performing content filtering lookups for an improperly derived URL when the certificate exchange used to establish an HTTPS connection was fragmented.Corrected an issue that could result in dynamic DNS certificates used for AnyConnect VPN failing to renew.Resolved an issue that could result in a disruption to traffic routing when configuration changes were made to MX appliances with a large number of AutoVPN routes.Fixed an issue that could result in Z3(C) appliances erroneously showing an orange power LED while they were connected and online.Corrected an issue that resulted in MX appliances not responding to ICMPv6 ping messages received on PPPoE WAN uplinks.Resolved an issue that resulted in MX84 and MX100 appliances having significantly reduced VPN throughput.Corrected an issue that resulted in the PoE status icons not being displayed in Dashboard for MX95 and MX105 appliances.Resolved an MX 16 regression that could have resulted in decreased AutoVPN stability for MX appliances with many AutoVPN routes.Known issuesAfter making some configuration changes on MX84 appliances, a brief period of packet loss may occur. This will affect all MX84 appliances on all MX firmware versionsDue to an MX 15 regression, the management port on MX84 appliances does not provide access to the local status pageClient traffic will be dropped by MX65(W), MX67(C,W), and MX68(W,CW) appliances if 1) The client is connected to a LAN port with 802.1X authentication enabled and 2)  The VLAN ID of the port is configured to 16, 32, 48, 64, 80, 96, 112, 128, 144, 160, 176, 192, 208, 224, or 240.There is an increased risk of encountering device stability and performance issues on all platforms and across all configurations.OtherMX appliances now support forwarding IPv6 no next header packets when configured in passthrough mode.â€¹ Previous version (MX 17.7)
